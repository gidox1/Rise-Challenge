PROVIDED QUERY:

SELECT users.id, users.name, posts.title, comments.content
FROM users
LEFT JOIN posts ON users.id = posts.userId
LEFT JOIN comments ON posts.id = comments.postId
WHERE comments.createdAt = (SELECT MAX(createdAt) FROM comments WHERE postId = posts.id)
ORDER BY (SELECT COUNT(posts.id) FROM posts WHERE posts.userId = users.id) DESC
LIMIT 3;

AIM
The query attempts to fetch the top 3 users with the most posts and, for each of those users, the latest comment they made. However, it's inefficient and needs optimization.

BOTTLENECKS
The provided query has the following possible bottlenecks
- The use of subqueries in the WHERE statement.
- The use of subqueries in the ORDER BY statement.


IMPROVED QUERY

SELECT
  u.id AS user_id,
  u.name AS user_name,
  p.title AS post_title,
  (
    SELECT c.content
    FROM comments c
    WHERE c.postId = p.id
    ORDER BY c.createdAt DESC
    LIMIT 1
  ) AS latest_comment_content
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN posts p ON u.id = p.userId
ORDER BY COUNT(p.id) DESC
LIMIT 3;

Advantages:
- Fewer subqueries and joins.
- Easy ordering by count of posts.
- top-level query to filter comments.
